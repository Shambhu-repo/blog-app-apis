Springboot security in api: 
1. role base authentication:->

1st: add dependency : <dependency>
				<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
				<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
				</dependency>
How it works :  -> this dependency makes all the api private and generate security password and create form based authentication-> we can see it in console 
                   user = "user"   password: can get from console
                   
                   
                   basic authentication: 
                   *******************
        -> how we can change spring security form based or web based security to api based security
        Ans: we ue java and make configuration -> annotation in class: @Configuration  ,@EnableWebSecurity
        
        extention: extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter
        and ->         method @Override
	protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception
	
	
	problem: in this basic authentication -> we need to send every time user and password . so to get rid of this we uee JWT Authentication
